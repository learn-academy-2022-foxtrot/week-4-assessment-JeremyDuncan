1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional 
programming?

Your answer:
* OOP is programming using Objects. This approach involves thinking in a way as 
we would in normal day to day life.
  * Example: Dog Class, Cat Class, Bunny Class 

* This entails having Classes which provide the layout of Attributes and 
Behaviors an Object will have when it is constructed from a Class.
* Class can be used to created multiple Objects from it's class
  * Objects can have different data such as a different name, as long as it
  follows the constructors of the Class it was created from. 
  * Modules can be used to add other functionality to created objects that may 
  necesarilly be a normal Attribute or Behavior of that class.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer:
* Float is a floating point number, meaning that it is number with a decimal 
place. Its more precise to use a Float for arithmetic operations.
  * Example: 1.5, 3.55, .003
  * Arithmetic Example: 7/2 = 3.5

* An Integer is a whole number and is less accurate when doing arithmetic 
operations due to numbers that may return decimal number being rounded down to 
the nearest whole number
  * Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -10
  * Arithmetic Example: 7/2 = 3

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer:
* Similar to JavaScript with Key:Value pairs, you would use the key in 
conjuction with the hash you were trying to obtain the value from with backet
notation.
  * If you were using a symbol for a key, you would have to add the ":" in front 
of the key. 
  * Keys can be any datatype.. such as strings, hashes, floats, integers, arrays 
  and so-on.
  
* Example: 
```ruby 
this_hash = {cherry: 'A small red fruit', jalapeno: 'A spicey addition to any dish'}

p this_hash[:cherry] # 'A small red fruit'
```
